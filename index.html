          <p>Travel restrictions brought by the pandemic have hit the pause button on China’s hospitality industry,
            which relies heavily on population movement. This has prompted local hotels to explore different business
            models to survive in the battered economy. However, the unequal impact and uncertainty brought by the
            epidemic have left many hotels unsure of their future.</p>

            <p>
              The country experienced several large-scale lockdowns following the Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020, which
              greatly restricted population movement. After more than half a year largely free of the virus locally,
              outbreaks recurred in the first and third quarters of 2021, continuing to hit the occupancy rate and
              performance of many hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People's Republic of China, the average occupancy
              rate of domestic hotels with star ratings in the first quarter of 2020 plummeted to 23%, more than halving
              the number in the same period last year, and has not recovered to 2019 levels in subsequent quarters.
            </p>
            <p>
              The decline in occupancy rates has led to a precipitous decline in revenue across the national hotel
              industry. In the first quarter of 2020, the revenue of star hotels nationwide decreased by 31.5 billion
              yuan compared with the previous quarter. In addition, their revenue in 2021 and 2020 fell by 28.8% and
              37.7% respectively compared to 2019.

          <p>
            China set its GDP growth target for 2022 at around 5.5%, which was the lowest in 30 years and has gone under
            even more pressure due to the deterioration of epidemic situation. The battered tourism and hotel industry
            reflects the broader pain China's economy faces as it continues the zero-tolerance approach when other
            countries shift to living with Covid.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has prompted hotels, including listed companies like Zhejiang SSAW Boutique Hotels Co., Shanghai Jin
            Jiang International Hotels Co., and BTG Hotels Group Co., to explore new business models to prevent closures
            due to dismal business conditions. In the long run, this can optimize hotel management processes and drive
            the digital transformation of the hotel industry. Still, the winter in the industry continues, and no one
            knows where their future holds.

              As China battles the recent flare-up of Covid-19 cases, Wang Xudong, manager of Shanghai Sea Cube
              International Hotel, felt unexpectedly relieved. His hotel began to see its revenue soar after suffering
              losses for months as a quarantine spot.</p>
            <p>
              "With the recent outbreak at home and abroad, our hotel occupancy rate has been almost 100% and we have
              made a lot of profits," said Mr Wang. "But it's just temporary. Six months ago, when the pandemic was
              stable, the hotel occupancy rate was only 15%."</p>
            <p>
              There are tens of thousands of hotels in China experiencing similar countercyclical situations after
              deciding to become quarantine hotels – providing centralized medical observation for inbound travelers and
              local close contacts under China’s strict quarantine rules. These quarantine hotels are providing strong
              support for China's Covid-Zero policy, but they are not able to find the backing for their future
              development.</p>
            <p>
              “Our business is tied to the pandemic, but no one knows what will happen tomorrow,” said Mr Wang. "We are
              struggling to survive and have no idea how this will end.“</p>

              The National Health Commission (NHC) on January 28, 2020, released the Protocol on Prevention and Control
              of
              Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, requiring the minimization of the movement of people. This has hit the pause
              button on the hospitality industry, which relies heavily on population mobility. </p>
            <p>
              Hotels began to receive calls from guests canceling their rooms or restaurant reservations. "For hotels
              across the country, almost all orders have been canceled, and there's nothing you can do about it." Mr.
              Wang
              said.</p>
            <p>
              According to the China Hotel Association, in the most difficult two months of January and February 2020,
              73%
              of hotels opted for "hibernation" — suspending their business to stop loss — for an average of 27.6 days.
              The remaining 27%, such as Mr Wang's hotel, are striving to hold on.</p>
            <p>
              Despite this, a lot of hotels didn't make it through the winter of 2020. The number of star-rated hotels
              decreased from 7,434 to 7,101 in the first quarter of 2020. By the second quarter of 2021, there were only
              6,894 star-rated hotels left nationwide.</p>

              As the domestic epidemic gradually stabilized, the hotel industry saw a rebound in occupancy rate and
              revenue in the second half of 2020. However, the recurrence of the outbreak continued to hit most hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              After struggling to stay afloat for a year, Mr Wang thought the dawn for his hotel was coming. But the
              recurrence of outbreaks in early 2021 brought the hotel industry to a halt once again.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Even with single-digit cases, it can take two to three months for local hotels to get back to normal, and
              months of earning will be lost,” Mr Wang said. “It's like there's no end to it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In this state of anxiety and helplessness, more and more hotels apply to become temporary quarantine
              areas. So did Wang’s hotel in January 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              “After becoming a quarantine hotel, our occupancy rate has increased by 70% despite the narrowing of the
              business scope,” said Wang. “Stable customer sources and cash flow are so important when everything is
              uncertain.”

              Zhao Cheng’s hotel in Hangzhou has just opened when the pandemic hit, and was immediately requisitioned by
              the government to serve as the quarantine hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zhao said there are many hotels like his that were "born" in the epidemic, they lacked operational
              experience, let alone customer bases. “We have no choice. Without receiving quarantined people, we make
              almost no profit and even face bankruptcy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The main sources of income for quarantine hotels are government-funded or quarantined people’s self-funded
              room fees.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, those hotels can make some profit from the meals served to the quarantined people. "The daily
              meal cost for each quarantined person is about 100 yuan, and we can make 40% to 50% of our gross profit.”

              There are also some listed corporations getting into the quarantine business. Zhejiang SSAW Boutique
              Hotels Co Ltd, which was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in September 2021, is one of them. The
              company has a total of 18 self-operated hotels. Among them, Hubin Hotel, Junting Hotel and Baiyang Hotel
              have been used as quarantine hotels since March 2020. Throughout 2020, the occupancy rates at the three
              quarantine hotels remained above 90%, while occupancy rates at other hotels hovered between 10% and 40%,
              according to the company's financial statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Although room rates for quarantined people are lower, quarantine hotels have the advantage of high
              occupancy rates and relative stability," the company said in its prospectus. With these advantages, the
              three quarantine hotels together contributed 46% to the company's net profit in 2020, far exceeding other
              hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the company saw a decline in its performance in the third quarter of 2021—recording a revenue of
              65.48 million yuan, down 17.26% year on year, and a net profit of 7.518 million yuan, down 46.38%. In
              addition, revenue for the first three quarters was 212 million yuan, lower than the 230 million yuan
              forecast.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Repeated outbreaks in the third quarter of 2021 led to a sharp drop in travel in the short term, which
              was the main reason for the decline in the performance of the company's other normally operating hotels,"
              said Peter Chen, an analyst at Southwest Securities. "However, this also shows that the company's
              performance, which relies on such a ‘special matter’ as quarantine hotels, is not sustainable.”

              Compared with SSAW Boutique Hotel, Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Co Ltd, one of the hotel
              giants, is mainly composed of mid-end and budget hotel chains. Even in the economy hit by the epidemic,
              the company's revenue in the first three quarters of 2021 was 8.3 billion yuan, up 19% from the same
              period last year.

            <p>
              In the first three quarters, the average occupancy rate of mid-end and budget hotels under Jin Jiang
              Hotels was 69.48% and 59.95% respectively, down 9.44% and 12.7% respectively compared with the same period
              in 2019. This signals a better recovery of mid-end hotels compared with budget ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, as of the end of September 2021, Jinjiang hotel had a total of 5,895 hotels, of which 548 were
              quarantine hotels. The vast majority of quarantine hotels were budget hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sam Zhou, an expert in hotel management, believes that compared with many low-end hotels with small
              volumes and poor risk resistance, mid - and high-end hotels, especially chain hotels, can manage to
              maintain their revenues or even expand during the epidemic due to their higher prices and stable customer
              base.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It is a good strategy to have some budget hotels that have been hit hard by the epidemic to be quarantine
              hotels, which can increase their occupancy rates and revenues, and help improve the overall resilience of
              the group," said Mr Zhou.

            <p>
              Despite the temporary revenue, quarantine hotels still face a number of challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, they have more stringent requirements in terms of operational management. According to the national
              regulations, quarantine hotels need to be transformed into three areas including a clean area, a polluted
              area and a semi-polluted area, and set up two channels for staff and centralized medical observation
              personnel; the elevators and carpets in the hotel should be repackaged and covered with mats for easy
              disinfection; the central air conditioners should be stopped altogether and replaced by separate hanging
              air conditioners in the rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hotel staff who receive quarantined guests need to take strict protective measures—putting on protective
              gowns, goggles, masks, foot covers, hoods, etc.— and conduct nucleic acid tests, temperature monitoring,
              non-contact environment disinfection and garbage disposal for quarantined guests on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>

              Mr Zhao said that during the time when his hotel was used as a centralized quarantine spot, the staff
              received more than 10 epidemic prevention training. "There are dozens of relevant detailed procedures,
              none of which can go wrong. “
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the epidemic has increased the operating costs of hotels. Mr Zhou said that in 2020, each
              hotel spent nearly 1,500 yuan per day on disinfection, Covid prevention and control equipment. Moreover,
              due to the frequent spraying of disinfectant throughout the hotel, many types of equipment are seriously
              corroded or even damaged, raising the cost of equipment replacement and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The increase in labor costs is also significant. "Mr Zhao said. “The high intensity and vulnerability of
              the epidemic prevention work have caused many employees to quit. In order to recruit people, we have to
              double salaries and provide employees with subsidies and benefits.”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-12 " style="height:30px">
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6">

            </div>
            <p>
              In addition to operating costs, the possible impact of the label "quarantine hotel" on brand image and
              consumer psychology is also a major concern for hotel practitioners. "We actually don't want people to
              know that we used to be a quarantine hotel, because we’re worried that this will influence customers'
              choices." Mr Zhao said. "Some consumers may be concerned that hotels that have provided centralized
              isolation may not be fully qualified in terms of hygiene and disinfection, and may have stereotypes in
              their minds. “
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr Zhang also believed that becoming a quarantine hotel may affect the future business to a certain
              extent. For example, in most cases, conferences in other provinces will give priority to hotels that have
              not received quarantined people under the premise of similar prices.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, he was optimistic that after the epidemic becomes normalized, the impact of the "quarantine
              hotel" label on consumer psychology will gradually disappear.

            <p>
              The large number of quarantines has also put a lot of pressure on the government's budget. Healthcare
              Expenditure in 2021 and 2020 was 1,920.5 billion yuan and 1,920.1 billion yuan, respectively, up about 15%
              compared with 2019. Among them, the Public Health Expenditure, which is directly related to epidemic
              prevention and control, reached 387.9 billion yuan in 2020, up 74.9% from last year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the heavy social burden of constantly pursuing zero cases, China has long stressed that such a
              strategy is the most cost-effective, otherwise the healthcare system could be overwhelmed by the rapid
              increase in cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The survival of quarantine hotels is inseparable from the financial support of the government. For local
              close contacts, the government needs to fully subsidize their cost of staying in quarantine hotels. For
              hotels that receive incoming tourists, the government will give corresponding subsidies for vacant rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wang said that the vacancy subsidy policy varies from region to region. For a place like Shanghai, which
              receives a lot of inbound tourists, the government may only subsidize about 50% of the vacant rooms. For
              second - and third-tier cities, which receive fewer inbound tourists, the government may subsidize 80% to
              100% to prevent large-scale empty rooms in hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, the number of arrivals to Shanghai is volatile. So we still have to deal with a lot of empty rooms
              and losses from time to time, “ said Mr Wang.
            </p>
            <p>
              A growing number of quarantine hotels are providing strong support for China's covid-zero policy, but they
              are not able to find the backing to support their future development.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Sometimes I even want time to stand still in this era of the pandemic," Mr Zhao said helplessly.
              "Otherwise
              I would have probably lost my hotel.”

              Tens of thousands of hotels in China have closed down due to the pandemic, with a closure rate of more
              than 20%. However, Wei Lai bucked the trend and opened a new hotel in Shanghai in June 2021. The new hotel
              is a franchise hotel under the Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Co Ltd.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The hotel has not made a profit since it opened and is just barely keeping afloat," said Mr Wei. However,
              he said that he had to open the business because he rented the property and paid for the renovation before
              the epidemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The longer I wait, the more I will lose. "
            </p>
            <p>
              The situation of various hotels has become more and more polarized after the epidemic. While it is
              increasingly difficult for independent hotels to survive, hotel groups are busy opening new hotels. In
              addition, mid-to-high-end hotel chains have suffered significantly less than budget hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the 2021 China Hotel Industry Development Report released by the China Hotel Association,
              there were nearly 60,000 fewer hotels in mainland China in 2020 than in 2019, of which independent hotels
              account for as high as 98%. Most independent hotels have a few sources of customers and eke out a living
              from quarantine businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              This comes at a time when the big hotel chains are accelerating their expansion. They either have strong
              financial resources or are mainly asset-light, hoping to grab market share amid industry turmoil. In 2021,
              the number of chain hotels and rooms in China greatly increase, whether high-end, mid-range or budget
              hotels. In particular, the number of high-end hotels increased from 3,200 to nearly 5,000, and the number
              of rooms increased from 500,000 to 700,000.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Independent hotels are far less tolerant of risk than the big chains,” said Sam Zhou, expert in hotel
              management. "Without the endorsement of the deep-pocketed hotel groups, it is difficult for them to
              survive in the sluggish economy and increasingly competitive market."

            <p>
              In the case of a bad economic environment and the aftermath of the epidemic, how can these hotel groups
              have the confidence to expand against the trend?
            </p>
            <p>
              After looking into the operating data of the above-mentioned companies, we can find that most of these
              hotel groups open new stores in the mode of franchise or light management, and franchising accounts for
              more than 80%. The number and proportion of the group's self-owned or leased hotels have gradually
              decreased in the past five years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stacey Zhang Tong, a professor at the Department of Tourism and Hotel Management of Xiamen University,
              believes that this kind of expansion can transform hotel groups from asset-heavy enterprises to
              asset-light ones, greatly increasing the speed of expansion and making them more resilient to risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under normal circumstances, hotel properties are mainly self-owned and leased, and rely on their own
              funds, loans, or financing to complete daily operations and store expansion, known as "asset-heavy" in the
              industry. The model of separating the light and heavy assets from the property and the brand, introducing
              the franchise model, and reducing leverage, is known as "asset-light" in the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specific to the "asset-light" model, two different ways have been derived, namely entrusted management and
              franchising. Under the entrusted management, the brand side needs to be fully responsible for the
              operation of the hotel, from the construction of the operation management system to the team formation and
              implementation standards. Franchising is even "lighter", handing over the business system such as brand
              intellectual property rights, operation management methods, marketing tools, and daily quality control to
              the owners, and not participating in the daily operation and management of the hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              "By using this way to expand, hotel groups can receive a lot of franchise fees and management fees with
              limited requirements for capital, increasing their cash flow without interest," said Stacey Zhang.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jin Jiang Hotel's franchise management fee revenue reached a maximum of 3.56 billion yuan, accounting for
              36% of its operating income. The franchise management fees of Huazhu and BTG Hotels Group accounted for
              30.76% and 21.99% of the operating income, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              On top of that, all three companies have positive operating cash flow and are sitting on piles of cash and
              equivalents. Huazhu, Jinjiang, and BTG have cash of 5.12 billion, 5.76 billion, and 3.16 billion
              respectively as of December 31, 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Even in the worst economic situation, the cash on hand can help them survive for several years.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Expanding to capture the market is another important reason. Stacey Zhang believes that the hotel industry
              is already a stock market, in the final analysis, whoever opens more stores can occupy the absolute
              advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Adopting a long-term asset-light strategy allows the groups to focus on their core business and thus
              accelerate the expansion of the hotel brand."
            </p>
            <p>
              For hotel groups, the more franchised hotel business, the better. It enables the groups to introduce
              themselves into the sinking market and popular destination without any investment, expand their brand
              awareness and competitiveness, and cultivate the inertial thinking of consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              "In addition to that, the pandemic and the recession just gave them a perfect opportunity," said Stacey
              Zhang. "Because they can buy a lot of high-quality, cash flow-broken companies at very low prices, which
              costs a lot less than expanding during the boom."
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, by the time the economy picks up, they've got a big chunk of the market, and future revenues
              will be flowing.

            <p>
              The expansion has allowed hotel groups to recover quickly after being hit in profitability in 2020.
              Although there is still a gap compared to 2019, their profitability is already far better than their
              peers. In the case that the profits of the entire hotel industry have not yet been corrected, except for
              Huazhu Group, Jin Jiang, BTG and InterContinental Hotels have all achieved positive net earnings of
              100.6million, 55.7million, and 1687million yuan in 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The profitability of leading enterprises is much better than that of their peers, and the independent
              hotels can't match them. This also shows that the chaining of China's hotel industry in the future is an
              inevitable trend,” said Stacey Zhang.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this business model of hotel groups is also equivalent to passing on the risk to franchisees.

              Stacey Zhang said that franchisees are usually responsible for their own profits and losses, and how much
              money they lose is not reflected in the brand companies’ financial statements in the short term. Instead,
              the companies charge not only franchise fees but also annual management fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It's the franchisees who suffer the most.”

            <p>
              The epidemic has hit the performance of hotels so hard, why do a large number of investors choose to join?
            </p>
            <p>
              Wei Lai is one of those who just joined BTG Group to open a franchised hotel. He said that everyone
              thought that after the epidemic, it should be the brand side to ask franchisees to join, but the reality
              is that many franchisees take the initiative to get closer to the hotel group.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Many franchisees are self-employed on a small budget, and they have invested in the initial investment
              before the epidemic. If they do not want their hotels to be completely closed, they can only find other
              ways to open."
            </p>
            <p>
              However, under the epidemic situation, both the government and guests have higher requirements for hotel
              elimination and environment, and they prefer to stay in branded chain hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Guests feel more comfortable staying in branded hotels, and the government is more willing to negotiate
              quarantine business with branded hotels," Mr. Wei said. "So I had to become a franchisee and pay this
              "branding fee."
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to franchisees like Mr. Wei, there are also some investors who were unable to sustain
              themselves after the epidemic and chose to join the hotel group to complete the transformation from
              low/mid-end to mid-end/high-end hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lu Yanbing’s hotel is located in Wuzhen, the northern part of Zhejiang Province. The hotel's positioning
              in the early stage of planning is mid-range, and the customer base target is tourists in the peak season.
              In order to make the hotel look fancier, he also spent a lot of money on renovation and hardware
              facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              But after several rounds of repeated outbreaks, local tourists plummeted. Her hotel was in a more
              difficult position after losing its main customer base.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms Lu said her hotel was not competitive in terms of price compared to the economy and express hotel,
              which did not attract local tourists. And her less well-known hotel brand didn't have an advantage over
              mid-range chains, either.
            </p>
            <p>
              "In this case, I chose to cooperate with high-end brands, so that I could completely monopolize the local
              high-end customer market."
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from that, many investors are eyeing the rapid development of the sinking market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yang Guangyuan joined the 7 Days Inn Hotel chain in early 2021. The hotel is located in Daqing city,
              Heilongjiang Province, one of the 70 third-tier cities in China.
            </p>
            <p>
              He said that during the epidemic, hotel groups reduced franchise fees to varying degrees, and he was able
              to apply for low-cost special refinancing from the government, which has greatly reduced the cost of
              opening.
            </p>
            <p>
              "My hotel is now mainly working with the government to receive quarantined people, which is actually
              losing money,” said Mr Yang. “However, I believe that after the pandemic, the business will get better, so
              it is most important for me to get the hotel opened first!”
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the four first-tier cities, 15 new first-tier cities, and 30 second-tier cities, there are
              more than 600 cities with sinking markets that still have a lot of room for development, according to
              Stanley Jiang, a senior economist at the New World Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Investors who choose to start their businesses in the epidemic can use the lowest cost to seize the
              sinking market with a large population size and consumption scale, paving the way for further exploration
              of greater consumption potential after the epidemic," said Stanley Jiang.

            <p>
              However, even for hotel chains, the blows faced by different star hotels are not the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Statistics for the first quarter of 2020 show that the number of one- and two-star hotels decreased by 11%
              compared with the previous quarter, while the number of four- and five-star hotels decreased by only 2.8%.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Mid - to high-end hotels have been able to maintain revenue through higher room rates at a time when
              occupancy rates at almost all hotels have plummeted,” said Stanley Jiang. “However, most of the low-end
              hotels have unstable customer base, lack measures and procedures in response to emergencies, and have poor
              risk resistance, therefore suffering much higher losses than the middle and high-end hotels.”

            <p>
              From the comparison of the business recovery of major hotel groups, we can also see the difference in the
              recovery of different levels of hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different from Huazhu, Jin Jiang, BTG and other hotel groups with various hotel types such as economy,
              mid-end and high-end, Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited is a chain brand focusing on mid-to-high-end
              hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of operating income, the revenue of the four major groups in the first half of 2021 achieved a
              general increase compared with the first half of 2020, but it was still uneven compared with the first
              half of 2019. Among them, Atour's business with a focus on mid-to-high-end hotels has the highest degree
              of recovery, and its revenue in the first half of 2021 has achieved a significant increase of 44% compared
              with the first half of 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, while atour's net profit base is not as high as that of other hotel groups, it is the only hotel
              to report a net profit increase from 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              Occupancy rate (OCC), average room rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR) are three important
              operating indicators for the hospitality industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comparing the occupancy rates of several hotels over the past three years, only Atour has achieved
              positive growth in the first two quarters of 2021 compared with the same period in 2019, while Huazhu,
              Jinjiang, and BTG have not recovered to pre-epidemic levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past two years, the average quarterly room rate of Atuo is far ahead of the middle end hotels of
              Huazhu, Jinjiang and BTG, and has long been higher than the average of the mid-to-high-end hotel industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              "On the one hand, it may have something to do with the social psychology that consumers are more willing
              to treat themselves better and prefer high-quality accommodation when sleeping out in the post-epidemic
              era,” said Stanley Jiang. “On the other hand, tourism may be intermittently suppressed due to the repeated
              impact of the epidemic, but business trips are basically normalized, and Atour enjoys high brand
              recognition among business travelers."
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Frost & Sullivan's report, the revenue of China's hotel chain industry increased from 245.4
              billion yuan in 2015 to 450 billion yuan in 2019, with an average annual compound growth rate of 16.4%.
              Despite the huge scale of the hotel industry, China's chain rate is only 31.5%, leaving plenty of room for
              growth. From 2021 to 2025, it is expected that mid-and high-end hotel chains will become the fastest
              growing segments in the entire hotel industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The proportion of mid - and high-end hotels in the hotels under Huazhu, Jin Jiang and BTG is increasing
              year by year, and the hotel groups have all said in their financial statements that they will continue to
              increase their proportions in the next few years.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Mid - and high-end hotels have shown strong resilience in the wake of the pandemic. Under the influence
              of consumption upgrading and consumption psychology in the post-epidemic era, the market recognition of
              middle and high-end hotels will continue to rise, and the market space is expected to continue to expand,"
              said Stanley Jiang.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another point to note is that the expansion of hotel groups in the long term does has its hidden danger.
            </p>
            <p>
              "By switching from asset-heavy to asset-light, hotel groups have lost absolute control over many hotels,
              making it more difficult to maintain overall brand and quality, " said Stacey Zhang.
            </p>
            <p>
              After all, she said, the brand side cannot fully control the behavior of franchisees. Once a franchisee
              fails to operate in accordance with the terms of the franchise agreement and meet the management standards
              of the branded hotel, the hotel it manages will experience a loss of customers and revenue, which will
              adversely affect the revenue of the hotel brand's business. In addition, if a franchisee misuses such
              brand trademarks, it may also damage its reputation and brand image.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tearing between the owner and the brand has also been the focus of controversy in the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fang Lixin's hotel used to be run by the local government, but was later incorporated into an
              international brand to raise its profile. In addition to the higher annual brand fee, the hotel's
              management is also appointed by the group and paid by the hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr Fang said that sometimes in a hotel with uncomplicated personnel, there will be many managers and vice
              presidents, and the number of leaders is even more than the number of ordinary employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              The salary of management is several times or even ten times that of ordinary employees, which is
              significantly higher than the average salary of local and similar hotels, and those positions with lower
              salaries, such as housework, kitchen, etc., are delayed in recruiting manpower. This not only makes the
              contradictions between employees increase day by day, but also greatly increases the hotel's human labor
              costs. In the case of not making money, the gap between the operator and the brand side will also arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite potential concerns, the expansion of hotel groups against the trend is inevitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The blow from COVID-19 has been unfair. Benefiting from the Matthew effect, the leading companies
              continue to achieve an increase in market penetration, while behind them is the demise of tens of
              thousands of hotels.
